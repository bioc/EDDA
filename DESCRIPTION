Description: EDDA can aid in the design of a range of common experiments such as RNA-seq, Nanostring assays, RIP-seq and Metagenomic sequencing, and enables researchers to comprehensively investigate the impact of experimental decisions on the ability to detect differential abundance. This work was published on 3 December 2014 at Genome Biology under the title "The importance of study design for detecting differentially abundant features in high-throughput experiments" (http://genomebiology.com/2014/15/12/527).
